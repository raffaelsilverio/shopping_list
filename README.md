# Shopping List

 Shopping List is an app where you can add your shopping list, to put and store the groceries you need. This project was started for me with HTTP requests, to build apps that store data remotely on a database with the help of a backend.
I learned how I can send HTTP requests, post data to a backend, send a post request, store data on a backend, and fetch data. And I also learned how to check for possible errors. How to extract the data that's sent back.
Here, I used Firebase, so we're decoding that JSON response.body,Â and we're then transforming it such that, in the end, we again have a list of grocery items.
With all these things, we're sending data back and forth.



## Lessons Learned
